# Space Invaders on VHDL

This project implements on hardware the space invaders game using a FPGA.
The device used is the xilinx fpga xc3s200-4ft256. 
This project was coded in VHDL and implements the game and the VGA driver from scratch.



## Getting Started

To start, you need to follow [this tutorial](http://riad.pk.edu.pl/~zk/ise7_start_tut.pdf) to install the Xilinx software.

Then, open the [main project](src/top_proyect.prj) in the ISE of Xilinx to program the FPGA. 
Also, you have to connect the VGA connector to a screen to be able to watch the game.
